In this project, I have set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a subnet within it. Additionally, I have created a custom route table and associated the subnet with it. To enhance security, I configured the default/main route table. Moreover, I created a security group and configured the default security group settings. To deploy an EC2 instance, I fetched the appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI), generated an SSH key pair, downloaded the corresponding .pem file, and restricted its permissions. Using the SSH key, I successfully connected to the EC2 instance. To streamline the process, I automated the SSH key pair configuration and integrated it into the Terraform configuration file. Furthermore, I utilized Terraform to install Docker and run an nginx image on the EC2 instance. To simplify the execution of multiple shell commands, I extracted them into a dedicated shell script. Finally, I accessed the nginx web server through a web browser, ensuring the successful deployment of the infrastructure.
